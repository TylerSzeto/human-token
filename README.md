# human-token
a satircal way for me to learn etheruem smart contracts 

This is a project I worked on between classes for about a week or so. I had it running on an actual website (humantoken.co) but I stopped paying rent money because I didn't have time to finish it up.

None the less, this was my exploration into learning how to use smart contracts with etheruem. Etheruem really, really, really doesn't like it when you lose tokens, and I had to find a really niche way to make it break.

I made this during the slow decline of ICO's after the honey moon period in cryptocurrencies from the 2017 dramatic rise. We saw coins like ponzi coin come out, with the sole intention of being a scam. This was my satirical take, but due to school and lack of sleep + nervous about sharing with the crypto community, I never formally released it due to budgeting issues.
