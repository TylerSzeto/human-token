# Java-Steganography-Beta

Hello friends

This is the a steganography program for java I have been working on. It's currently open source and anyone's free to contribute.
Although not the fastest, it's very easy to understand the implementation, and is very developer accessible.


Over the next days I will be adding formal documentation to my program.
